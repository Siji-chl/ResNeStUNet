# ResNeStUNet
Implementation of the network for meningioma segmentation.

# Description
The network is a modified 3D UNet. We use the ResNeSt blocks, proposed by Zhang et al. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08955.pdf)], in the encoder.

# Dependencies
The code is only tested in the environment as following
- Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
- Python 3.6.13
- Pytorch 1.1.0
